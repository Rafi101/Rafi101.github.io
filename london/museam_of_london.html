            <li><p>The Museum of London documents the history of London from prehistoric to modern times. The museum is located on London Wall, close to the Barbican Centre as part of the striking Barbican complex of buildings created in the 1960s and 1970s as an innovative approach to re-development within a bomb-damaged area of the City of London.</p>

<p>It is a few minutes' walk north of <a href="stpauls.html">St.Pauls cathedral</a>, overlooking the remains of the Roman city wall and on the edge of the oldest part of London, now its main financial district. It is primarily concerned with the social history of London and its inhabitants throughout time. The museum is jointly controlled and funded by the City of London Corporation and the Greater London Authority.</p>

<p>The museum is the largest urban history collection in the world, with more than six million objects. It hosts more than one million visitors each year.</p>

<p>In March 2015, the museum announced plans to move from its Barbican site to nearby Smithfield Market. The move, contingent upon raising an estimated Â£70 million, is planned to be complete by 2021</p></li>
