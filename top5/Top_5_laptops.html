        <h1>Top 5 laptops</h1>
        <img src= "images/top5.png" width="200">
        <ul>
            <li>1:Dell XPS 13</li>
            <li>The Dell XPS 13 is the best laptop money can buy</li>
CPU: Intel Core i3 – i7 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 | Screen: 13.3-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080) – QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) | Storage: 128GB – 512GB SSD
            +Faster than ever Same +long-lasting battery -Still poor webcam position -No Windows Hello
            With the 2016 model, the Dell XPS 13 reigns supreme as the best laptop you can buy today. Thin and light with a battery life that exceeds 7 hours, according to our movie test, Dell’s flagship laptop is the posterchild for Ultrabooks. Once again, too, Dell has managed to squeeze a 13.3-inch screen into an 11-inch frame, proving the nigh-borderless InfinityEdge display to be a design marvel. Outfitted with Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors and lightning-fast storage and memory, the Dell XPS 13 is dressed to impress with welcome addition of a Rose Gold color option as well. It should comes as no surprise, then, that we still rank it as the best Ultrabook and best laptop overall.</li>

            <li>2:Asus ZenBook UX305</li>
            <li>Better than the MacBook and at a fraction of the price</li>
            CPU: Intel Core Intel Core M3-6Y30 – M7-6Y75 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 | RAM: 8GB | Screen: 13.3-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) – QHD+ (3200 x 1800) IPS display | Storage: 256GB – 512GB SSD
            +Incredibly thin and light +Vibrant, +glare-free screen -Weak sauce graphics -Tinny speakers
            If you're looking for a Windows alternative to Apple's latest rose-tinted MacBook, the Asus ZenBook UX305 might be more your speed. Though it looks like a Cupertino design from every angle, it's actually superior to Apple's creations in almost every way. From its purple-tinged aluminum design to its sharp display and hearty helping of built-in storage space, the UX305 puts Windows back in style, fanless design, long battery life and all. And, while the low-cost is enticing, if you're shopping for something with a bit more horsepower (not to mention an even more compact design), look no further than the Asus ZenBook 3.</li>

            <li>3:Razer Blade Stealth</li>
            The gaming Ultrabook you’ve been waiting for
            CPU: Intel Core i7 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 | RAM: 8GB – 16GB | Screen: 12.5-inch, QHD+ (2,560 x 1,440) – 4K (3,840 x 2,160) IGZO LED-backlit multi-touch | Storage: 128GB – 1TB SSD
            +Captivating, colorful display +Greatly improved battery life -Cumbersome charger -Keyboard needs more travel
            The Razer Blade Stealth is an exceptional Ultrabook hindered only by its efforts in trying to be a gaming laptop. Price-wise, it has the upperhand against key competitors, but don’t be fooled – with an Intel Kaby Lake Core i7 processor, the latest Blade Stealth is more powerful and power-efficient than ever. Better yet, this laptop can change the lighting of each key on its keyboard, with more than 16.8 million colors to choose from. Plus, if you mind the integrated graphics from Intel, you can attach a (albeit rather pricey) Razer Core external GPU enclosure for boosted performance when stationary.</li>

            <li>4:Asus Chromebook Flip</li>
            <li>The winning premium Chromebook formula</li>
            +Elegant tablet mode +Gorgeous, vivid screen -No out of box Android app support -Middling speakers
            When Asus first came out with the Chromebook Flip as a “premium” offering, we were skeptical. Premium Chromebooks had been done before with little to no fanfare. After all, who would want to spend over a grand on a laptop that’s limited to the Chrome browser and a handful of Android apps? This concept becomes more enticing when you cut the price in half, as Asus has skillfully accomplished with the latest Chromebook Flip. Stacked with a gorgeous design, a keyboard that feels rich to the touch and even a 2-in-1 form factor, the Asus Chromebook Flip proves that Chromebooks can be premium without going overboard.</li>

            <li>5:HP Spectre x360</li>
            A well-rounded 2-in-1 that exceeds expectations
            CPU: Intel Core i5 – i7 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 | RAM: 8GB – 16GB | Screen: 13.3-inch FHD 1,920 x 1,080 – UHD 3,840 x 2,160 IPS multi-touch | Storage: 256GB – 1TB SSD

            <li>+Ultra-thin and light styling</li>
            <li>+Long-lasting and quick-charging battery</li> 
            <li>-Lacks SD card reader -Especially thick bottom bezel</li>
            The 13.3-inch version of the HP Spectre x360 may not boast the SD card slot of its 15.6-inch sibling, but what it does pack is virtually identical performance in a more compact shell. In fact, it’s 13% thinner and 11% lighter than the previous convertible laptop of the same name. For the price, it’s tough to beat, what with a 4K screen and a transformative design for the price of the entry-level MacBook Pro.

            Then there’s the keyboard, which went from 1.5mm to 1.3mm of travel this time and still feels significantly better when compared to previous HP Spectre x360 models. What’s more, despite having a lengthy battery life of 8 hours and 45 minutes, according to our own movie test, the HP Spectre x360 still manages to weigh no more than a mere 2.85 pounds. Just when we thought there wasn’t a laptop that’s cutting-edge in every category, the HP Spectre x360 proves us wrong.</li>
