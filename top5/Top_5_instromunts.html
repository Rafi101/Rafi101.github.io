        <ul>
            <li>1:Electric Guitar</li>
            <li>It wasn’t until recently that the electric guitar became the most popular instrument on the top ten list. Before that, the piano was actually in first place. However, the electric guitar now has the top spot. The rise can be attributed to several factors. For one, there’s the popularity of pop and rock and roll artists and music. There are countless videos and movies displaying artists playing electric guitars as they enjoy themselves and woo the crowds. In addition, video games which allowed people to play the guitar – such as Guitar Hero – are extremely popular as well. No matter what, the electric guitar sales and lessons have elevated enough to become the number one instrument to play.</li>

            <li>2:Piano</li>
            <li>The piano is one of the most popular instruments in the world. That’s because it is so versatile and can be played in just about any music genre. The piano can also be played solo. In America alone, there are about 21 million people who play it. While it is more expensive than an electric guitar, it is still very popular. Many music producers, artists and conductors rely on the piano as a way to create some of the best music available. The fact that the piano can be used by itself for someone to perform or entertain others, also makes it that much more popular and powerful.</li>

            <li>3:Violin</li>
            <li>The violin is considered one of the most beautiful sound producing instruments in the world. It is also one of the oldest which has been around for centuries. Furthermore, the violin has hardly changed during all those years. For various musical genres, the violin is an integral and important part of it. Users begin playing it as early as 6 years old. It is a great instrument for kids to start out which may explain why it’s so popular.</li>

            <li>4:Drums</li>
            <li>Although not as quiet as other instruments, the drums have a high popularity overall. Playing the drums allows a player to lose themselves in the moment. Since drums play an integral part of so many music genres, it is unlikely it will ever fall from the top ten position. Still, for anyone who has to go through the beginning of a drummer’s playing career, it can be overwhelming and difficult.</li>

        <li>5:Bass Guitar</li>
        <li>In the instrument world, bass guitar is probably the most underrated instrument. It is also one that people sometimes fail to respect. However, the bass guitar is very essential to numerous music genres. Compared to other similar instruments, it is easier to learn though.</li>
