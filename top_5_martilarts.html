        <ul>
            <li>1.karate</li>
            <li>Derived from a Japanese word meaning “empty hand,” karate is just that — a martial art in which no weapons are used (but sometimes they  use weapons I do karate and I use knunchucks). Karate’s early styles are believed to have originated as early as the 1300s, but the father of modern karate, Anko Itosu, wrote the "10 Precepts of Karate” in 1908, giving birth to the martial art’s code. Karate consists of weapon-less(and sometimes with weapons) striking in which the legs and hands become spears, claimed Itosu.</li>

            <li>2.Kung fu</li>
            <li>Kung fu, a Chinese martial art that literally means an accomplishment gained through hard, long work, is one of the oldest martial arts in the world. Chinese Yellow Emperor Huangdi, who took the throne in 2,698 BC, is said to have introduced martial arts to the country during his reign; tens of thousands of forms of kung fu have existed since then.</li>

            <li>3.Taekwondo</li>
            <li>Translated as “the way of the fist and foot,” taekwondo flourished after World War II, when Japan ended its occupation of Korea. Known for its kicks, this martial art combines physical skills with mental strength, often shown when the follower breaks boards with a foot or hand</li>

            <li>4.Ninjutsu</li>
            <li>Brought to the North American mainstream by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the historic followers of this mysterious Japanese martial art were guerrilla warriors and assassins. Likely considered criminals today, these ninjas used the art of stealth to surprise and defeat their opponents. Born in Japan’s feudal age, ninjutsu was developed to kill. Hands and feet are used in this martial art, but followers also take weapons training, using devices such as throwing stars, staffs, spears, swords and even explosives.</li>

            <li>5.Judo</li>
            <li>Judo was founded by Japanese educator Kano Jigoro, who was bullied during his childhood in the 1860s and 1870s. Taking basic skills from other martial arts of the day, he added his own throws to create modern-day judo. The word’s prefix “ju” means “soft method,” which, loosely translated, means using the opponent’s strength against him. Due to this method of self-defense, judo practitioners need not have overpowering strength themselves.</li>
